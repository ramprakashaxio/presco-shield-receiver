## 2. Receiver Integration & Data Forwarding

### 2.1 Hardware & Power Setup
- [ ] **ESP32 Charger & Power**
  - Configure stable power supply; monitor battery/back-up if needed.
- [ ] **Peripheral Initialization**
  - Initialize SD card, display, or other interfaces as applicable.

### 2.2 BLE Central & Data Parsing
- [ ] **Scanning & Connection**
  - Scan for HealthGuard advertisements; connect and manage parameters for throughput vs. power.
  - Implement auto-reconnect logic.
- [ ] **Data Reception & Validation**
  - Receive sensor packets; parse timestamped payloads; validate integrity (CRC/checksum).
- [ ] **Command & Configuration**
  - Send BLE write commands to adjust beacon settings (sampling rates, thresholds); handle acknowledgments.

### 2.3 Wi-Fi & Cloud Forwarding
- [ ] **Wi-Fi Connectivity**
  - Configure SSID/password; implement reconnection and fallback logic.
- [ ] **Data Transmission to ThingsBoard or Other Dashboards**
  - Choose protocol (MQTT or HTTP); format payload per server requirements (device ID, timestamps, sensor values).
  - Buffer data locally when offline; retry on reconnection; secure via TLS if supported.
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Detect failures; implement exponential backoff; log errors for debugging.

### 2.4 Read/Write Interface & Automation
- [ ] **User Interface or API**
  - Optionally provide minimal web or console UI on ESP32 for beacon configuration.
- [ ] **Automation & Scheduling**
  - Schedule periodic tasks (nightly data sync, firmware checks); implement accordingly.

### 2.5 Monitoring, Logging & OTA
- [ ] **Local Logging**
  - Store received data (e.g., SD or flash) as backup.
- [ ] **System Health**
  - Monitor ESP32 resource usage (memory, CPU) and connectivity status (BLE, Wi-Fi); alert if issues.
- [ ] **OTA Updates**
  - Implement OTA mechanism for ESP32 firmware (HTTP or cloud-based).
- [ ] **Diagnostics**
  - Provide logs accessible via serial or network for troubleshooting.
